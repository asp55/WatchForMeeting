# WatchForMeeting
A [hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org) spoon to answer the question
> Are you in a meeting?

Watches to see if:
1) Zoom is running
2) Are you on a call
3) Are you on mute, is your camera on, and/or are you screen sharing

And then shares that information via websockets either to a self-hosted webpage, or an external server such as [http://github.com/asp55/MeetingStatusServer](http://github.com/asp55/MeetingStatusServer) which you can then load on a screen in another room.
